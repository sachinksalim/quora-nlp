# Quora Question Duplication: Natural Language Processsing

Quora is a question-and-answer platform where users ask and answer questions of
diverse topics. One of the challenges faced by the Quora community is the presence
of multiple questions with the exact or similar meaning. Thus, detecting whether
two questions are semantically similar or not helps in organizing the content by
merging the pages of those questions.

We tested out three different approaches in order to detect this semantic similarity.
First one was Bidirectional LSTM with Attention. Then we tested out
a Time Distributed Layer with Concatenation approach and finally, LSTM with
Multiplication.
